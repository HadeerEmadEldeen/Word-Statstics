Specs table contains the specifications data. Its ID is just an auto increment column to identify the
record. Its Name column identify the name of the specification. Its Value column identify the value
specifies for the corresponding mentioned name.
Device table contains the devices data. Its ID is just an auto increment column to identify the record. Its
Name column along with the Type column identifies whether the device either appliance or sensor and
mentioning its name. Its ParentDeviceID identifies which sensors are contained in which devices. This is
being represented via a self-relationship. Its SpecID identifies the specification of each device.
Worth mentioning that this schema should be used as is. You should not attempt to change anything ,
e.g., don’t think about creating a bridge (many-to-many) table between Specs and Device tables.
